The team inputs risk-adjusted manufacturing estimates, a
   small portion is subtracted to provide a "safety stock," and the
   remainder is divided by population. The safety stock reserves about 5%
   of doses off the top that act as a buffer to account for uncertainties
   or issues that arise as the delivery plan is executed.

   Population numbers for the states and metropolitan areas were derived
   from the American Community Survey as published by the U.S. Census
   Bureau using a 2018 data release. Populations of the U.S. territories
   -- American Samoa, Federated States of Micronesia, the Commonwealth of
   the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of Palau, the Republic of
   the Marshall Islands, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands -- came from the
   Central Intelligence Agency's World Factbook.

   While four of the five federal entities provided their own population
   estimates, Operation Warp Speed's leadership approved a final working
   figure for the Defense Department population to account for active duty
   service members, their family members, military retirees and DOD
   civilians.

   Like any complex plan, Operation Warp Speed made some allowances where
   it made sense, Maddox explained.

   One such decision involved allocations to the Indian Health Service and
   the potential for inequity within tribal populations. Indian Health
   Service determined its population by polling 706 Indian Health
   facilities nationwide, asking each to decide whether to receive
   vaccines from the agency or their resident state.

   "We identified the potential for imbalance where tribal populations
   opted to receive vaccines from the state where they reside," Maddox
   said.

   As a remedy, Operation Warp Speed created a "sovereign nation
   supplement" for those states with Indian Health centers that did not
   choose to affiliate with Indian Health Service. The solution adds a pro
   rata calculation to those states based on the state-supported Indian
   Health centers.

   Geographically isolated areas, such as Alaska, American Samoa, Guam and
   the Northern Mariana Islands, may order up to their monthly allocation
   in advance, to be delivered in the first shipment of the month. For
   some locations, the delivery includes both first and second doses of
   the two-shot vaccines.
